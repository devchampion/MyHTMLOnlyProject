	<h1>This is just for play code</h1>
	<p>This section talks about few playcodes that i have done and played with. 
	Let me show you some of them</p>
	<ul>
		<li>BLOCK ELEMENT: This going to be a brief note about block element.
			<p>These set of elements consists of all headers, blockquote etc. They are called block element because they take their space and push every other tag around them away.</p></li>
		<li>INLINE ELEMENT: Here is a brief note about inline element
			<p>These is the opposite of what block element is. Rather than taking a whole new space for itself, it accomodates other element e.g p-tags, bold-tags etc.</p></li>
		<li>STRONG & EPMPHASIS: There is no big/noticeable difference between the <strong>STRONG</strong> and the <bold>BOLD.</bold> I use strong most times brcause it is better for me.
			<p>The <em>Emphasis</em>and <italics>italics</italics> has no difference but we use emphasis because it is shorter and kind of tells a beginner it's work from the first view.</p> </li>		
		<li>HORIZONTAL RULE: The tag responsible for horizontal rule is hr. The name alone tells you what they do. Look at this
					<hr>
				That was a horizontal rule.</li>	
	</ul>
