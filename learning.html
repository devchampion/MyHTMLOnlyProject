	<h1>This is going to be about my learning experience</h1>

	<p>One of the things i learnt from Mr. Temidayo, my coding teacher is to never let excuses slow you down. The excuses are only there to make you stronger. so i will be listing some of the hthings I have learnt in this coding training.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Always show up early</li>
		<li>Always have on paper what you want to achieve rather than just grabbing the computer to avoid confusion</li>
		<li>Always keep your definitions brief and simple</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Difference between coding and programming</h3>
		<p>The big difference is this Coding is a part of programming that deals with writing of codes that the computer can understand while Programming is a process that creates programs that involve the ratification of codes, which making the codes the official one for the program. </p>
	<h3>Bug and Debugging</h3>
		<p>Bugs are simply errors made while coding and programming while fixing those errors is called Debugging. </p>
	<h3>Git and it uses</h3>	
		<p>Git is used for keeping track of progress made in your local directory</p>
