<h1> WELCOME TO MY HTML ONLY TASK</h1>
	<p>here you will find all other learning and tag I have learnt so far.
	Let's begin...</p>

	<h2>HEADERS</h2>
	<p>Just like the size of this "HEADER", it's all part of headers. Headers are.... The name says it all, they are always bold and have large text</p>

	<h2>PARAGRAPHS</h2>
	<p>Paragraphs are the easiest, infact this is a paragraph. they are simply the beginning of a new line. you see coding is simple.</p>
	<h2>LISTS</h2>
	<p>Listings can be ordered, or unordered.. The ordered one's have numbers e.g 12334. While the unordered could be bulleted points or dash points, it all depends on what you want</p>
	<ol>
		<li>This is an ordered list, obviously because it has numbers.</li>
		<li>This one is another</li>
		<li>E nor hard</li>
	</ol>
	<p>Watch out for this one now..</p>
	<ul>
		<li>This is an unordered listing, this is simply because it has no numbers rather bulleted points...</li>
		<li>Here is another</li>
	</ul>
